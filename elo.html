                                "Disco? Very." To simply label Discovery as a disco album would be an insult to what is 
                                a great album filled with great love songs. Even with the success of Out of the Blue, 
                                Discovery is considered by 
                                most fans to be ELO's greatest album.

                                Considered to be the first ever concept album about time travel, Time has divided fan opinion since
                                its release given how much more "electronic" it sounds compared to the more orchestral style of 
                                previous albums.

        After spending their formative years having only relatively average success with albums such as On the Third Day, Eldorado and
        Face the Music, it was only after the release of Out of the Blue then did ELO start to achieve global fame as its extensive
        use of synthesizers and the Vocoder captured the attention and imagination of the masses. Following it up was the just as
        renowned Discovery and a string of subsequent hits and misses which include Time, the soundtrack to Xanadu, Secret Messages 
        and Balance of Power.
