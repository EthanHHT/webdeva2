                                With no official title, Led Zeppelin's fourth studio album is commonly referred to IV, or Led Zeppelin IV.
                                Recorded with criticism of Led Zeppelin III in mind, IV, with its high quality and impactful music, was
                                the perfect answer to critics who still had any reservations about the band.

                                Following up an album as great as IV was going to be no easy feat, even for Led Zeppelin. But with
                                Houses of the Holy, they did just that, abandoning their darker rock sound for a far more clean
                                and refined style.

                                A favourite, especially among die-hard fans, Physical Graffiti was the only double LP ever recorded
                                by Led Zeppelin. Originally meant to be a single LP, an excess of material, especially good material,
                                led to them deciding to push a double album instead.

        Originally supposed to be a supergroup fronted by guitarist Jimmy Page, joined by Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds as well as 
        the Who's John Entwistle and Keith Moon, Jimmy Page eventually had to settle with forming a band with the likes of John
        Paul Jones, Robert Plant and John Bonham. From those early days in 1968 to John Bonham's untimely demise in 1980, 
        Led Zeppelin would spend most of the 1970s leading the way in rock n' roll.
