                                Considered to be the best album of all time, but not the best Pink Floyd one, The Dark Side of the Moon
                                was the peak of the progressive rock movement. A concept album, it touched on topics such as anxiety, 
                                time, death, greed, war and mental illness and no album since has resonated with the world as much it did.

                                hit back at the brutality of the machine that was the music industry.

        After the mental breakdown of their former frontman Syd Barrett, the quartet of Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and 
        Nick Mason were stuck in a limbo for quite a few years. Did they want to carry on with their psychedelic identity pushed onto
        them by the public, or would they look to innovate and evolve further? 1970's Atom Heart Mother and 1971's Meddle, which included
        the 23 minute-long Echoes, proved they chose to head in the latter direction and 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon would prove 
        to be their magnum opus of their prog-rock journey.
